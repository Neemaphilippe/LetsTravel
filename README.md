# LetsTravel

LetsTravel is an organizational app for the traveler who is always on the move but loves to be prepared and organized! The app is broken down into two categories: Before Travel and Travel Day. This allows the user to plan ahead and have everything in one place for a seamless travel experience. The first screen displays the user's upcoming trips with the option to add a new one. The user can switch tabs and store their important travel documents and create reminders (boarding pass, parking, etc.).
